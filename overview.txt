This is a single page website which contains a main centered container. This container holds multiple unordered lists, each of which are built using tables. We will store each methodCategory as an object in the methodCategoryArray. Each methodCategory holds the 5 (or 2) methods and their respective outputs, and are mapped to a tabled list featuring a main header that says the title of that category, and two table headers implying 'operation' and 'output' columns. The following rows are populated with their values according to the methodCategory data structure. Remember that each list needs to be a table.
